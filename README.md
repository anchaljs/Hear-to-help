# Problem Statement
Even though a visually impaired person can use screen reading software but it does not make the Internet surfing experience very smooth if the websites are not designed accordingly. 

Visually impaired person depends on the image description for understanding whatever is represented through pictures. But most of the time, websites do not provide clear image description.

# Overview of our Idea
We plan on making a chrome extension that will not only read the content of the webpage when a user's cursor hovers over it but will also give a description of the images on the website. 

We are also planning to enable navigation based on user's voice input.

#Tech Stack Used
* Selenium for web Automation
* CSS/HTML/Bootstrap for Frontend web extension page
* JavaScript for Web extension
* CNN Model for image feature extraction
* LSTM Model for Natural Language Processing
